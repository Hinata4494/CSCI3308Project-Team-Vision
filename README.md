# CSCI3308Project-Team-Vision
Semester long project to create a twitter bot, functionality of twitter bot to be determined.

Members:
-Michael Condon	
-Matthew Kaiser	
-Maxwell Lambek	
-Spencer Negri	
-Chiu Ming Tsang	

Risks:
Our team is a variety of skill levels in both ability and knowledge of programming. This will make it difficult for some members to complete every task to make a working project.
Our team's schedules do not match up well which makes communication and teamwork difficult.

Risk Mitigation Plan:
There is always something somebody can do as we all at least know the basics of programming. Tasks will need to be divided based on experience levels and knowledge for what needs to be done.
By using tools like slack and email we can each work on the project in the time we have and view each other's messages when our schedules allow it.

Version Control: GitHub

Collaboration Tool: GMail and Slack
