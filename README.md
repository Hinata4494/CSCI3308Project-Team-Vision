## Description
In this project we will be taking tweets and extracting some properties from the tweets and putting those properties into a DB. We will then take the data and run some analytics on the data. For example we could extract hashtags that all relate to an event, and take their geo-tag, then we can estimate traffic flow around what that hashtag was relating to since we have 2 locations associated with a tweet.

## Motivation
This project could potentialy produce some very interesting and valuble information from free data. For example if you want to know what the traffic will be like on a road 10min from now this project could create an estimate for that traffic.

## Vision Statement
The goal of the project is to be able to run analytics on twitter data to predict interactions.

## Risks
Our team is a variety of skill levels in both ability and knowledge of programming. This will make it difficult for some members to complete every task to make a working project.
Our team's schedules do not match up well which makes communication and teamwork difficult.

## Risk Mitigation Plan
There is always something somebody can do as we all at least know the basics of programming. Tasks will need to be divided based on experience levels and knowledge for what needs to be done.
By using tools like slack and email we can each work on the project in the time we have and view each other's messages when our schedules allow it.

## Version Control: GitHub
